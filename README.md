# TensorFlow_Image_Classifier
Explored a Convolutional Neural Networks pre-trained model,Inception, to build an Image Classifier. I used Tranfer Learning as well. The project is aimed to identify and classify all the Darth Vader pics based on the given dataset. The goal is to expand this model to create a classifier for scientists to make their job easier.
